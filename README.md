## Installation

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

### Via HACS
* Add this repository as a "Custom repository" with type "Lovelace"
  * Click on HACS in your Home Assistant
  * Click on Frontend
  * Click on the 3 dots in the upper right corner and select "Custom Repositories"
  * Add the URL to this GitHub repository (https://github.com/dingausmwald/lovelace-brokkoli-card) and the category "Lovelace"
* Click on "Install" in the new "Brokkoli Card" card in HACS
* Wait until the installation is complete
* You don't need to restart Home Assistant, but you probably need to refresh the frontend and/or use "Shift-Reload" to update the browser cache.

### Manual Installation
1. Download the files `brokkoli-card.js`, `brokkoli-area-card.js`, and `brokkoli-list-card.js` and add them somewhere in your `<config>/www/` folder in HA
 
2. Click on your profile picture in the lower left corner -> Enable advanced mode.
 
3. Go to Configuration -> Lovelace Dashboards -> Resources -> press the + (bottom right corner of the screen) and add the following information:

```yaml
  Url: /local/<path to>/brokkoli-card.js
  Resource type: JavaScript Module
```
Repeat this for `brokkoli-area-card.js` and `brokkoli-list-card.js`.

4. After that, press *Create* to add the new resource.

5. You don't need to restart Home Assistant, but you probably need to refresh the frontend and/or use "Shift-Reload" to update the browser cache.

## Dependencies
1. Custom Plant Integration (https://github.com/dingausmwald/homeassistant-brokkoli)

## Communication Between Cards

All three cards can communicate with each other when configured with matching identifiers:

1. Set an `identifier` in the Brokkoli Area Card or Brokkoli List Card
2. Set `listen_to` in the Brokkoli Card to the same value
3. When you now select a plant in the Area or List Card, the Brokkoli Card will automatically update
